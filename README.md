# Project Euler Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to mathematical problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) implemented in C++. Project Euler is a platform that provides a collection of challenging computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are meant to be tackled with computational approaches, making them a great way to enhance programming and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific problem on Project Euler. Each folder contains a C++ source code file (`.cpp`) that implements the solution to the respective problem.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, you can use any C++ compiler. Simply compile the source code file for a specific problem and execute the compiled binary.

```bash
g++ -o problemX problemX.cpp
./problemX
